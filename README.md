🎬 Netflix Movie Recommendation System
🧠 Project Overview

This project is a content-based movie recommender system built using Netflix’s public dataset.
It suggests movies similar to a user-selected title based on genre and description similarity, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

An interactive Streamlit web app lets users search or select movies and view detailed recommendations with metadata like genre, cast, and rating.

🚀 Features

🔍 Smart Search – Find movies via dropdown or fuzzy search (tolerates typos).

🎞️ Personalized Recommendations – Suggests top 5 similar titles using content-based filtering.

📊 Metadata Display – View each movie’s genre, cast, rating, and summary.

⚡ Lightweight & Fast – Runs entirely on precomputed cosine similarity (no database needed).

🧩 How It Works

Combines textual features (description + listed_in) into a single “tags” field.

Converts these tags into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.

Calculates cosine similarity between all movies.

Returns the top 5 most similar titles for a given movie.
